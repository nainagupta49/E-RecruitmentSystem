Due to the digitalisation of the interview application process, companies are receiving thousands of applications for a position, making the shortlisting process challenging. Manually shortlisting the resume is a time consuming task, which also introduces biases in the process. The manual shortlisting is an inefficient task as the recruiter can not compare the thousands of applications from each other. Moreover, many applications don’t pass the minimum qualification criterion, and tossing out them is also a big task. Our web portal aims to deal with all these challenges in order to make the process of recruitment smooth and efficient.
